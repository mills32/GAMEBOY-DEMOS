# GB GAMES

Two games that are using ZGB Engine in GBDK.

Now updated to work with sdcc compiler, so the roms are working much better and faster (still need lcc linker)

They are working in both DMG and GBC very well.

LUNA: a fully working platformer, 12 levels.

FUZZY: a de-make of fuzzy's world of miniature space golf, 12 levels and I'll consider it complete.

Thanks to ZALO for the amazing ZGB engine.
